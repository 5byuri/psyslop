## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This bot[net] will go into drama focused youtube channel comment sections and will recommend people to pick up healthy habits instead of consuming media without end. 
<br> 
## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
python
pip
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/5byuri/psyslop.git
```

And repeat

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Create a `.env` file, add your credentials for the systemvariables to be in scope.

On Linux, you can either set `export SB_MAIL="string"` in your terminal for quick testing
if used permanently then copy into your shell `./{shell}rc config`
